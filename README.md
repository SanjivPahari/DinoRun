ABSTRACT

A computer can be used in a variety of ways. People use computers in accordance
with their needs. People's lifestyles have also changed dramatically as a result of
technological advancements. Games have become popular on computer as well. Kids,
teenager, everyone loves playing game on computer.

A programming language can be used to create a variety of useful apps and
software on a computer. C, C++, C#, Java, Python, QBASIC, and others are examples of
programming languages. We are particularly interested in the C programming language
out of all of these computer languages. Dennis M. Ritchie created the C programming
language, which is widely used to create a variety of system and application software.
This programming language has a wide range of applications including game
development.

We have developed a simple game in c-programming language. The game is titled
‘Dino Run’. In this game, the player guides a pixelated dinosaur across a side-scrolling
landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score. The player presses the spacebar
to jump the given obstacle. If the player hits the obstacle, the game ends there.

Here the program for the game was written in C programming language and various
functions are used to accomplish the final result. The following are the functions used in
the program.

Int main()
It is the main function of program. The execution of the program starts from here.

Void menu()
This function is used to display the initial menu to choose for user.

Void Dino_Game_Home()
This function is the home screen displayed after user chooses to play a new game.
Every part of the game is displayed within this function.

Void Dino_Game_Main_Display()
This function displays the data including the current score and the highest score of
user.

Void top10_score()
this function displays the highest 10 scores scored by users.

Void your_rank()
this function displays the highest scores scored by a specific user.

Void reset_history()
This function is used to reset all the data that is stored including the highest score
and user data.

Void updatae_highscore()
This function is used to update the highest score in real time.

Void print_obstacle()
This function prints the obstacles for dino to jump .

Void print_dino_upperbody()
This function prints, as the name suggests, the body of the dino in game.
